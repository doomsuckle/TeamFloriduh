         <h2>The Beginnings:</h2>
         <p>While we take health care, and data science seriously, #TeamFloriduh also wanted to have some fun with the challenge, and explore ideas outside of the predictable ho-hum fraud analysis.  As three relative strangers with completely different backgrounds, we started throwing hypotheses at the wall. Soon it was clear we needed some domain branding and organization or else our database tables would end up with unpublishable names.  The #TeamFloriduh moniker started as a joke, partly in homage to the world's worst superhero (<a href="https://twitter.com/_FloridaMan">FloridaMan</a>) and partly due to the unique factors that make healthcare in Florida such a puzzle.  This central focus on local problems was a driving factor in our overall analysis, and the unifying aspect of our team.  Realizing that many of the competitors hail from enterprise healthcare organizations, the name stuck, embodying our indi spirit, and relaxed attitude, while allowing our data analysis to shine unclouded and remain accessible to the the public.</p>

        <p>Data science should be fun.  Healthcare should be approachable. Information should be accessible.</p>

        <h2>Case Study:</h2>
        <p> Imagine you’re a 67 year-old man with newly-granted portal-based access to your clinical data, a Blue Button advocate who’s already downloaded your past 2 years of claims data from your local Blue Cross plan, and an enlarged prostate who’d like to retire to Florida. You’ve researched cost of living, retirement communities, gas prices, and hospital facilities in Jacksonville, Tampa, West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, and Miami. You’ve researched healthcare providers who claim to be urologists and accept Medicare, but your wife and kids are concerned that you’re making an arbitrary choice. How do you determine whether these providers routinely perform the services you know you’ll need, and are within bladder-controlled driving distance of your target neighborhoods?</p>

        <p>Next, imagine you’re a payer network management director, reviewing the next ACO provider contract proposal. To effectively address reimbursement rates and manage cost of care throughout the care continuum for an attributed member population, you have to ensure each product and service required for your attributed patient-member population is adequately covered, and that patients have access to provider-member care within geographic proximity. How do you identify potential gaps in ACO network coverage, requiring new provider contracts to address? </p>

        <p>#TeamFloriduh is approaching the newly-released CMS data set from a consumer empowerment perspective, by geographically analyzing The Void between available routine service-providers and the consumer, as well as population health issues created when there is a Health Service Desert. By identifying geographic voids in particular specialties and procedures, consumers are empowered to make better choices about their health provider options, as well as to engage and inform policy decisions driving such agendas as PCMH certification.</p>
