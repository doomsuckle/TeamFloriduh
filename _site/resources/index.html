<p>The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/04/14/medicares-big-data-dump-is-just-that-a-dump/">public reaction</a> to the recent CMS public data dump has been met with <a href="http://thedifferentialdiagnosis.com/post/82529405583/cms-and-its-data-dump">mixed</a> <a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140410/NEWS/304109936">reactions</a>.  While transparency has generally been valued, many are concerned about the ethical implications of providing so much information to the general public without the means necessary to understand, critically evaluate, or use it meaningfully. To us, that just sounds too much like the doctor telling the patient "don't bother with independant research, you wouldn't understand." </p>

<p>Answering the question "How can the general public benefit" from such data dumps is two-fold.  First, as data scientist, we have an obligation to present information in an accurate manner.  Unfortunately, this is often not the case, and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/dataview/2014-04-17/how-americans-die.html">wildly popular data visualizations</a> from well known publications are still missleading. The statistical background necessary for critical analysis is lacking in our community. The first step to helping the public benefit is to leverage data dumps like these to spur interest and education. Second, it's a great platform to dissect analysis methodology, and walk consumers through the process so that they may start with their own analysis. True data transparency is more than just raw numbers.</p>  

<p>Education is more democratic now than ever, and information is more accessible, to the point of overload.  Neat data visualizations will only go so far if the consumer can't evaluate them critically.  In this spirit, we are blogging real time about our exploration, and curating a list of resources for those interested in understanding the foundation of data science. This is an ongoing project, beyond HDPalooza. If you know of good resources, please <a href="mailto:hello@laurencstill.com">let us know</a>! </p>

<h3>Statistics</h3> 
<p>Data scientistists are often <a href="http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/">described</a> as those who are better at software engineering than a statistician and better at statistics than any software engineer. As such, statistical inference underpins much of the theory behind data analysis and a solid foundation of statistical methods and probability serves as a stepping stone into the world of data science. There is an abundance of information freely availible for those needing a refresher in stats and statistical programming.</p>

<p>A trustworthy, practical, well structured statistical reference book is a great supplement for online dynamic information, particularly when it comes to the fundamentals. These may be particularly useful if you already have some knowledge of the subject or just need to fill in some gaps in your understanding. Work through one, mark it up, break the binding and show print some love.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>Programming serves a dual function when it comes to data science:  it is first and foremost the tool used for statistical analysis, but it is also the foundation for communication and education. Python is a great multi purpose language capable of handling both analysis and platform develovelopment, but familiarity with other languages and frameworks strengths and weaknesses can help narrow down the decision making process for more advanced operations. </p>


<p>While <a href="http://www.datarobot.com/blog/r-getting-started-with-data-science/">R</a> is the de facto standard for statistical programming, it has quite a high learning curve. For those new to both programming and statistical analysis, Python is well suited for a number of specific problem domains, in addition to general web development.  Many of the functionalities of R can be replicated with <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="http://scipy-lectures.github.io/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/">IPython</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and many more <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/03/python-data-tools-just-keep-getting-better.html">statistical libraries</a>.</p>
