've not taken a look yet -- I will today, I promise. I'm as giddy as a school boy so ! want to tell you guys this bit of information, because this is fucking bad-ass and I want to get your wheels turning: 

I think the void is going to be our best bet. Here's why:

1. There are 3406 distinct procedure descriptions in Florida. (codes sometimes map to multiple descriptions, so I used distinct descriptions)
----
select count(distinct hcpcs_description)
from florida
order by hcpcs_description;
----

2. If we look at the procedures available per city, this never comes close to 3406. I attached a screen shot of the top 10. 

----
select nppes_provider_city as city
	, count(distinct hcpcs_description) as numTypes
from florida
group by nppes_provider_city
order by count(distinct hcpcs_description) desc
----

I really wasn't expecting the result in 2. I also have it queued up to look at: 

-- number of providers grouped by [per area (a city cluster) , procedure]
-- ([number of providers] /[area population] ) grouped by [per area (a city cluster), procedure]
-- ([average number of procedures] / [area population]) grouped by [per area (a city cluster), procedure]
-- If we can cluster procedure types, we can look at set differences and look at coverage per class of procedure. 

Note I mentioned city cluster there. I need to figure out how we're going to cluster the cities. I think we should check this initially for a couple of cities. 

I've put florida on its own in the dropbox for faster plays as well as thevoid.R, which has all the queries I'm using to do this initially. I'm basically using R as a means of holding the outputs of my queries for later use and numerical analysis. Muahahahahaha. 


The big challenge for this is clustering cities (We should compare a few major areas nationwide initially if this is hard and just cluster this manually. I have a nationwide image in my head where we take the major areas and create a dot that scales with the number of available procedures and a color that changes with availability. 

Another idea for our visualization is we take a map of the USA and create a heat map of the procedure per capita. There can be a selector on the side where one can take the procedure and create the updated projection. That'd take some stabbing with D3. 

All we need to match this is some census data. Then we can draw some correlations. (There's a lag, but it's not that far off temporally so ~5 years won't change the population migration that much.)
